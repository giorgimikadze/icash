            <p id="ertip" > We’re laying the foundation for the next generation of blockchain-based gaming – starting with our own social
                gaming site, FaceOff. We want you to be a part of it.</p>
            <p id="orip">Starting in December, we will be making iCash tokens available to the public and launching FaceOff, which allows
                players to make peer-to-peer social sports challenges and win cash prizes based on the outcome of skill-based
                contests. In the meantime, we’d love for you to join our mailing list so that we can keep you up to date
                on the latest developments with iCash. We have a larger vision for iCash that goes beyond blockchain-based
                gaming, too, which makes this a very exciting time to be involved in the online gaming and cryptocurrency
                spaces.</p>
