        Starting in December, we will be making iCash tokens available to the public and launching FaceOff, which allows players
        to make peer-to-peer social sports challenges and win cash prizes based on the outcome of skill-based contests. In
        the meantime, we’d love for you to join our mailing list so that we can keep you up to date on the latest developments
        with iCash. We have a larger vision for iCash that goes beyond blockchain-based gaming, too, which makes this a very
        exciting time to be involved in the online gaming and cryptocurrency spaces.
